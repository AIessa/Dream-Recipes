# Dream-Recipes
(NLP) Bot generates made-up (and potentially magical) recipes to solve any problem that the user inputs.


To execute, make sure you have all the requirements installed:

python3

nltk

fasttext

numpy

pickle

json

tracery

pathlib


Also be aware that this programme requires a 'model.bin' file in the 'data' directory. Please check for further instructions on how to get training data and train your model in the README.txt in the 'data' directory.

All set?

To execute the code:
1) go into the main directory 'Dream-Recipes': cd ./Dream-Recipes
2) run the main.py file: python3 main.py


There are many ways to customize this code, for example you can change the grammar and vocabulary in recipe.py and rules.json, change the dialogue in main.py or manipulate the way ingredients are retrieved in ingredients.py. 

Good luck and have fun!
